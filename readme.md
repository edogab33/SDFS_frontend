# SDFS_frontend

This is the frontend part of the project Satellite Driven Fire Simulator: http://mclab.di.uniroma1.it/site/index.php/projects/60-sdfs-por-fesr-2014-2020-aerospazio-e-sicurezza

The backend can be found here: https://github.com/edogab33/SDFS_backend

This repository serves only as a demostration since the database is not publicy available. Can be used to see how you can work with OpenLayers + OpenStreetMap and how to easly make it possible to work with coordinates in different standards (in this case the database uses EPSG:3035 while the frontend uses EPSG:4326).
